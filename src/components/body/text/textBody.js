                    We provide services involving production of caramel lollipops,
                    both in flat and spherical form, as well as powder lollipops.
                    We manufacture both sugary and sugar-free lollipops, including those
                    based on xylitol. We offer various forms of lollipop packaging: foil,
                    wrapper and flow pack. At your option, we can pack lollipops in bulk
                    them with new solutions. While taking special care of the smallest consumers of lollipops, children,
                    we ensure that each lollipop has a stick with a safety fix, preventing it from slipping off the lollipop.
